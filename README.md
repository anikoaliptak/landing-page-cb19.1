DEVELOPMENT INFORMATION

The CSS reset is in the head part of html.

The CSS rules are divided into 3 parts in the css folder.
  - basic.css, for the global CSS rules
  - layout.css, for the CSS rules of the layout
  - component.css, the CSS rules for the components that build up the page

The CSS files start with comments about the CSS rules in them.

I used the CSS Grid to arrange the components on the page, and Flex-box to arrange the elements
inside the grid-items.
